Dear Reader,

I am a Software Engineer, but I fancy applying engineering everywhere. 

I really believe in the power of data to interpret life. I'm interested in the cross-pollination of engineering fields to solve problems. 

I think the future of living will look like multi-storied cities with deep integration of nature. My gut on the future of work is towards hybrid - one where different people spend some months apart, then a month together - with a room in their homes optimized for working.

I love chatting about product case studies with my friends - something valuable comes out of it everytime.

Let's build something cool together.

Love,
Aryan.
