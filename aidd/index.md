# AI Deep Dive

**Context:** I am feeling a little rusty on my AI skills, it has been a while. Preparing for a remedial deep dive beyond the basics.

**Plan:** (a)read a paper a week, (b)synthesize the crux and results (c)implement (d)reproduce results.

**Special Notes:**
1. Papers may be removed from the list
2. Very old papers likely won't be implemented
3. GPU constraints could prevent (d)
4. Likely using Colab for Code. Not going to look at the original implementation.
