COVID-19 has created a wave(or three :eyes:) of lasting personal and professional transformations that made remote work acceptable to the world. Families have learned to cooperate with meetings, fridays have been reclaimed by employees as their leisurely workday and bosses have learned to endure the discomfort of not having their reportees in front of their eyes 24x7. 

Now that remote work is a possibility, startups - especially those without an office space - have jumped on to this bandwagon. In fact, it has become one of their advertised benefits. This is in contrast to behemoth corporations that have leased office spaces going to waste; management has had to negotiate with employees and meet in the middle with hybrid work. Corporations are realizing that it is becoming less important to have an office space, but more important to support employees working from where they are.

In this environment, we need new and innovative ways to support working from outside office. Specifically work from ANYWHERE (not home).
