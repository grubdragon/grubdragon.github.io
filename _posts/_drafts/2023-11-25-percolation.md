I manufactured the phrase. Read it as "How much of the textbook went in".

Measuring what went in is the most important metric for educational content in my book(pun intended). But boy, does the education industry get it wrong.

Having sit in classrooms/lectures almost all my life, I noticed a phenomenon that has plagued my learning experience throughout. The one where I "switch off" after a few minutes of almost any class. And if you have been even minutely self-aware about your learning process, you probably know what I'm talking about - the depth of your understanding is sinking by the minute, till it drops off to incomprehensibility, and you slip into a daydream.

Sad part is, this isn't for a lack of trying. Many educators are looking to help students discover the joy of learning; many students are looking to be a sponge and extract the most out of the lesson. But the spark dies, slowly and surely, on both sides. For the educators it manifests as a exhaustion of attempts - "I have no willpower left to try again". For students its as sleeping in class or sleeping in, missing class.

I still remember my first class in IIT Bombay. IITB is India's most prestigious engineering university and everyone who enters the college does so through a difficult physics, chemistry and mathematics exam called JEE. It takes 2 years

Well, it was the first lecture and everyone was going to class. I remember the auditorium was full, from the first bench to the last.

And it continues. The more I try to learn, the worse I think the problem is. Even when I want to read books today, I face immense trouble. Let's say I pick up a self help book like "Deep Work". The book is undoubtedly great. I found it really impactful in some sections. But the process of reading it was a complete nightmare; it took me greater than 2 months to get through it. At many points in the journey, the effort could have gone to waste, because it was never entertaining or rewarding. It's a huge problem if this was the case for a *GREAT* book, especially one that I *WANTED* to read specifically.



All is not lost.
