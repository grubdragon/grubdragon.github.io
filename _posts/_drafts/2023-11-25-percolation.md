I manufactured the phrase. Read it as "How much of what I studied went in". Feel free to substitute "Textbook" by its general spirit to mean any educational content. 

Measuring what went in is the most important metric for educational content in my book(pun intended). But boy, does the education industry get it wrong.

Having sit in classrooms/lectures almost all my life, I have noticed a phenomenon that has plagued my learning experience throughout. The one where I "switch off" after a few minutes of almost any class. And if you have been even minutely self-aware about your learning process, you probably know what I'm talking about - the depth of your understanding is sinking by the minute, till it drops off to sheer incomprehensibility, and you slip into a daydream.

I still remember my first day of classes at IIT Bombay. IITB is India's most prestigious engineering university and undergraduates who enter the college do so through a difficult physics, chemistry and mathematics competitive exam called JEE Advanced. It takes 2 years of hard work at the very minimum to secure a good rank in the exam, which can then help you find a place in one of the IITs. [^1]

Anyway, coming back to my first classday; everyone was proceeding to their respective lecture halls like a rookery of penguins. I remember the footpaths being flooded and the classes packed. Bright 18 year olds were waiting keenly for their lecture to start. This was the fruition of their hard work over the past n years, this is what they were waiting for. As the clock struck 8:30, a professor comes in, projects his slide deck, introduces himself and proceeds to teach. Then another and another. And as the day went on, the young minds that had been waiting eagerly for this day for so long, shut down one by one.

And over that week, the footsteps towards the academic area dwindled. At some point during, the dawn of realization had swept over many; students had stopped seeing the point of going to class. By the end of the month, some classes had as little as a 10 person attendance and *this is out of approximately 250*. This made me appreciate how difficult learning is when the conditions aren't pristine.

What compounds my sorrow is that this isn't for a lack of trying. Many educators want to help their students discover the joy of learning; many students are begging to be shone the light of knowledge. But the spark dies anwyay, slowly and surely, on both sides. For the educators it manifests as a exhaustion of attempts - "I have no willpower left to try again". For students it shows up as sleeping in class or avoiding class altogether.

Sad part is, this isn't for a lack of trying. Many educators are looking to help students discover the joy of learning; many students are looking to be a sponge and extract the most out of the lesson. But the spark dies, slowly and surely, on both sides. For the educators it manifests as a exhaustion of attempts - "I have no willpower left to try again". For students its as sleeping in class or sleeping in, missing class.

Well, it was the first lecture and everyone was going to class. I remember the auditorium was full, from the first bench to the last.

And it continues. The more I try to learn, the worse I think the problem is. Even when I want to read books today, I face immense trouble. Let's say I pick up a self help book like "Deep Work". The book is undoubtedly great. I found it really impactful in some sections. But the process of reading it was a complete nightmare; it took me greater than 2 months to get through it. At many points in the journey, the effort could have gone to waste, because it was never entertaining or rewarding. It's a huge problem if this was the case for a *GREAT* book, especially one that I *WANTED* to read specifically.



All is not lost.
