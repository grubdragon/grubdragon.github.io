title: We Use Empirical Evidence Everyday!

Pattern matching is the bread and butter of life. We are all running mini science experiments based on our empirical evidence everyday; we discover patterns, play around with the variables and create an optimal outcome for ourselves. What's more, we are using hundreds of inferences emerging out of these experiments everyday!

Think about the times you've observed something and adjusted your protocols. Maybe its your shower knob, whose setting you've probably memorized to achieve that optimum temperature for a relaxing bath. Or its the times you keep your window open to get the cooling just right. It could be avoiding a certain vegetable because it seems to give you tummy trouble. It's all about modelling the observed patterns and reshaping your behaviour.

Empirical evidence is so important, we have a whole field of study based solely around learning from it(starts with 'machine') and it has taken the world by storm.

In fact I believe empiricism forms the foundation for traditional Indian medicine. Pattern matching was probably done in two ways: to identify the disease through the observed symptoms and to discover the cure via accumulated herbal wisdom. Consequently, stories and *nuskas* were woven around those patterns to create a legend, which was passed down generations. Now so many aged indians swear by ayurveda, even in the face of modern medicine, which is based on robust statistical inference.

There are two important lessons here for a startup: the power of human empiricism and stories. Lots of brands have survived because of their stories and the internet has enough podcasts on how a brand was made by its stories. But talking about this is not my cup of tea.  

The empiricism part is the kicker, because when you conduct experiments and observe results, you create something remarkable for yourself. If you're able to optimize the outcome of an important problem for yourself, the experiment concludes and a new habit is formed[^habit]. That's where a startup gets in - optimizes *some* objective for a customer to become the product of choice and creates a sticky habit out of it. 

The importance of empirical evidence is that its exceptionally difficult to refute, even when you're presented with damning proof against it. I believe it's a flaw in the human experience - what you see has exceedingly more impact than what you read. In product sense[^prodsense], it implies showing some results fast to the user. This creates personal empirical evidence for customer which creates stickiness and keeps him motivated to stick around for the complete(and hopefully super important) offering.

Kevin Hale has a talk on "How to Evaluate Startup Ideas"[^KH], which covers habit formation briefly. He explains that the three prongs of habit formation are
- **Motivation** ⇒ I have this crazy burning problem
- **Ability** ⇒ I can see a solution to my problem in this startup
- **Trigger** ⇒ Thing that get’s them to realize OH! I need to solve it with your startup
In this framework, empirical evidence is part of the trigger because it makes the customer realize that this is how I should solve the problem.

So far, knowing what you're optimizing has been the lofty goal. But, if you aren't able to get some wins fast for your customer, consider your goal difficult. And notice how I tricked you into thinking I loathe stories, but I wrapped up the importance of empirical evidence in my own ;).

[^habit]: Habit formation is only weakly positively correlated with the importance of the problem in my experience. You fix the , even if its not that big of a deal right?
[^prodsense]: I hate this word.
