title: The Tyranny of Empirical Evidence

Empirical evidence is a beast of a tool. It derives its power from its ability to be exceptionally difficult to renegade, even when you're presented with damning proof against it. I believe it's a flaw by design in the human experience[^flaw] - what you see has exceedingly more impact than what you read about.

We use empirical evidence everyday because that is how we fundamentally learn. Almost every moment of our lives revolves around inferences extracted from hundreds of thousands of micro-experiments, pattern matched. The bread and butter of life itself is to discover patterns, play around with its controlling variables and create an optimal outcome for yourself.

Think about the times you've observed something and adjusted your protocols. Maybe its your shower knob, whose setting you've memorized to achieve that optimum temperature for a relaxing bath. Or its the times you keep your window open to get the cooling for your home just right. It could be avoiding a certain vegetable because it seems to give you tummy trouble. It's all about modelling the observed patterns and reshaping your behaviour.

The fuel to the fire that is empirical evidence, is a backing story. Stories are the basis for how homo sapiens ended up coordinating in large numbers[^harari], so no wonder they play a huge part in strengthening one's convictions. Wrap your empirical evidence up in an impactful tale, and you are well on your way to influence mammoth crowds. A great, believable story which fits at least some of the facts can immensely reinforce a belief. At that point, that story could be treated as dogma, which makes the evidence close to irrefutable, and any lemmas coming out of it now become axioms.

In fact I believe empiricism forms the foundation for traditional Indian medicine. Pattern matching was probably done in two ways: to identify the disease through the observed symptoms and to discover the cure via accumulated herbal wisdom. Consequently, stories and *nuskas* were woven around those patterns to create a legend, which was passed down generations. Now so many aged indians swear by ayurveda, even in the face of modern medicine, which is based on a far stronger proof of robust statistical inference.

Why this is interesting to me, is that there are two important tools to wield here for a startup. And why wouldn't there be, a startup is about solving problems for other humans. If you can leverage human empiricism and create a narrative around it, it will serve you well. Lots of brands have survived due to their compelling stories and the internet has enough podcasts on how a brand image was shaped by this narrative. But talking about this is not my cup of tea.

The empiricism part is the kicker for me, because when you conduct experiments and observe results, you create something remarkable for yourself: you create personal empirical evidence. If you're able to optimize the outcome of an important problem for yourself, the experiment concludes and a new habit is formed[^habit], which encapsulates learnings from your empirical evidence. That's where a startup gets in - optimizes *some* objective for a customer to become the product of choice and creates a sticky habit out of it. 

In product sense, it implies showing some results fast to the user; those results will act like the evidence you need to keep the customer motivated to stick around for the complete(and hopefully super important) offering.

Kevin Hale has a talk on ["How to Evaluate Startup Ideas"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtCl5PU8F0), which covers habit formation briefly. He explains that the three prongs of habit formation are
- **Motivation** ⇒ I have this crazy burning problem
- **Ability** ⇒ I can see a solution to my problem in this startup
- **Trigger** ⇒ Thing that get’s them to realize OH! I need to solve it with your startup
In this framework, empirical evidence is part of the trigger because it makes the customer realize that this is how I should solve the problem.

So far, knowing what you're optimizing and do it well, has been the lofty goal. But, if you aren't able to get some quick wins for your customer, how are they going to be around for the do it well part?

[^habit]: Habit formation is only weakly positively correlated with the importance of the problem in my experience. You fix the , even if its not that big of a deal right?
[^flaw]: Much like the addictiveness of gambling. (Thanks to Michael Seibel for that insight)
