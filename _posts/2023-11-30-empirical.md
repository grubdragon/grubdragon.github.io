title: We Use Empirical Evidence Everyday!

Pattern matching is the bread and butter of life. We are running mini science experiments everyday and using their inferences hundreds of times!

Think about the times you've observed something and adjusted your protocols. Maybe its your shower, whose knob setting you probably memorized to find that optimum temperature for a relaxing bath. Or its the times you keep your window open to get the cooling right. Could be avoiding a certain vegetable because it seems to give you tummy trouble. It's all pattern matching.

In fact I believe this forms the foundation for traditional Indian medicine. Pattern matching was done in two ways - to identify the disease and to discover the cure. Consequently, stories and *nuskas* were woven around patterns to create a legend, which was passed down generations. Now so many aged indians swear by ayurveda, even in the face of modern medicine, which is based on robust statistical inference.

There are two important observations here for a startup: the power of experiments and stories. Stories are the part I don't care much about, so I am going to skip that. The internet has all the people in the world talking about brand stories and how they really drove home the point of a product, but that's not why you're here.

The experimentation part is the kicker. Something remarkable happens when you conduct experiments. If you are able to optimize the outcome of an important problem for yourself, the experiment concludes and a new habit is formed. That's where a startup gets in - optimizes *some* outcome for a customer to become the product of choice and create a sticky habit out of it. 

The beauty of empirical evidence is really that its exceptionally difficult to refute it, even when you're presented with robust proof against it. I believe it's a flaw in the human experience - what you see has exceedingly more impact than what you read. In product sense[^prodsense], it implies showing empirical results fast.

So far, knowing what you're optimizing has been the lofty goal. But, if you aren't able to get some wins fast for your customer, consider your goal difficult.

[^prodsense]: I hate this word.
