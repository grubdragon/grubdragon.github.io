> I am coining the phrase. Read it as "How much of what I studied went in". Feel free to substitute "Textbook" by its general spirit to mean any educational medium. 

Measuring what went in is the most important metric for educational content in my book(pun intended). But boy, does the industry get it wrong.

Having sit in classrooms/lectures almost all my life, I have noticed a phenomenon that has plagued my learning experience throughout. The one where I "switch off" after a few minutes of almost any class. And if you have been even minutely self-aware when studying, you probably know what I'm talking about - the depth of your understanding is sinking by the minute, till it drops off to sheer incomprehensibility, and you slip into a daydream.

I recall my first week of classes at IIT Bombay. For context, IITB is India's most prestigious engineering university and undergraduates who enter the college do so through a difficult physics, chemistry and mathematics competitive exam called JEE Advanced. It takes an aspirant 2 years of hard work or more to secure a good rank in the exam, which can then help you find a place in one of the IITs. [^1]

Picture this: our first classday, students waddling towards their lecture halls to find seats, at 8 in the morning. The footpaths were flooded and the lecture halls packed to capacity. Freshly minted college graduates were waiting keenly for their class to start. After all, this was the fruition of their hard work over the past n years. As the clock struck 8:30, a professor enters, projects his slide deck, introduces himself and the course and proceeds to teach for about half a lecture. 

That's where the downfall began. The content was covered hastily and the professor was a bit unclear at times. There wasn't a tinge of enthusiasm or excitement in his voice. More professors walked in, repeated this a few times over. It was a tiring day for the learners. This was followed by 4 more days of this replayed. And as the week went on, the young minds that had been waiting eagerly for this week for as far as they can remember, were shutting down one by one.

Over the month, the footsteps towards the academic area dwindled. At some point during, the dawn of realization had swept over many; students had stopped seeing the point of going to class. By the end of it, some classes had as little as a 10 person attendance and *this is out of approximately 250*. This made me appreciate how difficult learning is when the conditions aren't pristine.

What compounds my sorrow is that this isn't for a lack of trying. Everyone in the system is trying really hard. Many educators want to help their students discover the joy of learning. Many students are begging to be shone the light of knowledge. But the spark dies anwyay, slowly and surely, on both sides. For the educators it manifests as a exhaustion of attempts - "I have no willpower left to try again". For students it shows up as sleeping in class or playing hooky.

And the plague continues till this day. The more I try to learn, the worse I think my problem is. Even when I want to read books out of my own self-interest, I face immense trouble. Let's talk about the time I picked up the self help book "Deep Work"[^2]. The book is undoubtedly great. Cal Newport has embedded a few really impactful nuggets in some sections. But the process of reading it was a complete nightmare. It took me greater than 2 months to get through it, and this is when I was reading it with my friends of my book club. Almost throughout the journey, I never felt motivated to read "just another page". It was always accompanied by mild dizziness and the gnawing pain of hard things.[^3] The effort could have very easily gone to waste, because it was never entertaining or rewarding. It's a huge problem if this was the case for a *GREAT* book, especially one that I *WANTED* to read specifically.

And oh my shame of constantly getting tired of watching course videos 

All is not lost.
