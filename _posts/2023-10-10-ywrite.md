title: On The Usefulness of Blogging
---

In an OKR driven society such as ours, any work being carried out for its' sake thereof, begs the question why. Now it is our turn to ask the dreaded existential question for this blog as well; why this blog? 

I'm afraid that's a good question, one I'm not bold enough to answer on most days. The reason is twofold; it feels cool to write something publishable for everyone to read(open access) and there are some things that need to be said that only my most fervent fans deserve to read(autofiltering).

With the fads of microblogging aka Twitter being the norm, it feels like an uphill battle to be writing. But that's the beauty of hard things - it imbues a gnawing pain in your temple that your median life is devoid of. And as it eats away at your brain, the usual train of thoughts arrive - carriages of "why am I doing this?" and "who am I doing this for?" driven by the engine of "is my time spent on this endeavour worth it?".
