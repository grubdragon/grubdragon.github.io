*Title inspired by George Orwell's "Why I Write".*

In an OKR driven society such as ours, any work being carried out for its' sake thereof, begs the question why. Now it is our turn to ask the dreaded existential question for this blog as well; why this blog? 

The reason is twofold; it feels cool to write something publishable for everyone to read(open access) and there are some things that need to be said that only my most fervent fans deserve to read(autofiltering).

With the fads of microblogging aka Twitter being the norm, it feels like an uphill battle to be writing. But that's the beauty of hard things - it imbues a gnawing pain in your temple that your median life is devoid of. And as it eats away at your brain, the usual train of thoughts arrive - carriages of "Why am I doing this?" and "Who am I doing this for?" driven by the engine of "Is my time spent on this endeavour worth it?".

But there is something magical about writing we discount. 

Although writing itself can be rewarding, the magic of writing is not in the written word. Its what the written word makes possible. Writing frees up the minds' cognitive reserves to engage in a more valuable pursuit, namely, critical thinking. This coupled with the additional working memory on your paper (or computer for that matter) makes writing an effective tool for reflection.

Paul Graham talks about the something similar in his post about putting ideas into words.[^1] A good writer doesn't just write, but discovers a range of ideas when he's writing. The beauty of the process is that reading what you've written many times over(obsessively proofreading when you write is pretty common) is what creates an exacting effect - half baked ideas become concrete.

And thus, this blog.
